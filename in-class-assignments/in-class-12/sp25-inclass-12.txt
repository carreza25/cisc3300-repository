Code that is being run within a function is known as a function context. 
In JavaScript variables and functions within each execution context are created before they are executed, this is called hoisting.
In each JavaScript execution context, the scope is the current execution context's variables object, plus the variables object for each parent execution context, this is called closures.
Encapsulation in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the practice of bundling data and methods into a single unit, or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the data.
