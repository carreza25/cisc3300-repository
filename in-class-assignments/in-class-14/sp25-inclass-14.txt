Objects in PHP use the arrow syntax to access object properties and methods. 
The visibility of a property, a method or a constant can be defined by prefixing the declaration with the keywords public, protected or private. 
When a class derives from another class: inheritance in OOP.
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond differently based on the same message. 
Namespaces allow the PHP interpreter to tell the difference between two classes, functions, or constants that share the same name.
