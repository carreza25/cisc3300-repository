MySQL (pronounced “sequel”) is a relational database program (one of many) that uses SQL queries. It is the flavor of SQL we will be using. 
A relational database uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database, these are called relationships. 
Normalization avoids data duplication by using relationships. 
We can query our tables for result sets of our data with the select* (* means all) statement.
