A website can tell a browser to store data about the user and their visit in a text file called a cookie.
Each time the browser requests another page from that domain, the browser sends the data in the cookie back to the server.
Browsers only send data in a cookie to a server when it is requesting data from the same domain that set it. 
Sessions store information about a user and their preferences on the server. 
Exceptions are thrown - they are intended to be caught. Errors are generally unrecoverable.
