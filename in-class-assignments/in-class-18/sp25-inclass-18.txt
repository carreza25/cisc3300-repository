SQL relationships are the established associations between two or more tables. 
For every record in the primary table, there are one or more related records in the foreign table: one-to-many (relationship type).
The join keyword allows you to request data from more than one table.
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table.
An aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.
