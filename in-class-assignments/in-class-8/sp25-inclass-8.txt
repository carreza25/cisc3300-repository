In certain programming languages the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, called the interpreter, reads and executes the code. This is called an interpreted language. 
Type checking is performed at runtime, means that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime, this is called dynamic typing. 
The automatic conversion of values from one data type to another is called juggling/type coerion. 
Non-primative data types are mutable and hold references to objects stored in memory. 
Strict equal (===) checks if two values are equal without type coercion.
